# CLAUDE.md

Agent entrypoint for **Sophiel**. Read this fully, then read `./docs/SPEC.md`.

`SPEC.md` is the source of truth. This file is a summary and a pointer — where the two disagree, `SPEC.md` wins.

## Current state

> **Update this block at the end of every work session. It is the first thing you and I both read.**

```
CURRENT MILESTONE:  M0 — Skeleton
STATUS:             complete — V1/V2/V3 pass
LAST VERIFIED:      2026-09-09 · installDebug on SM-S721B (Android 16), app launches, no crash
BLOCKED ON:         —
NEXT:               M1 — Model conversion and parity
```

Milestones are **strictly sequential**. Do not start M(n+1) until every verification item in M(n) passes. If you believe a milestone should be skipped or reordered, stop and ask.

---

## Before you write code

1. Read `SPEC.md` §0 (operating rules) and the section for the current milestone.
2. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` — it records why things are the way they are. Do not relitigate a settled decision without asking.
3. If the task touches permissions, capture, or the overlay, read `SPEC.md` §4 in full first. That section is the highest-risk area of the project and it is written to be followed literally.

## Hard rules

These are absolute. Violating any of them is a defect, even if the code works.

| #   | Rule                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **No `INTERNET` permission**, in any manifest, including debug and test. This is a verifiable product claim, not a preference. |
| 2   | **No model training or fine-tuning.** Pre-trained weights only.                                                                |
| 3   | **No captured frame is ever persisted.** Frames stay in memory. Only scalars (hashes, scores, timings) may be written to disk. |
| 4   | **No image data is ever committed to git.** `eval/images/` is gitignored. Commit labels and metrics, never pixels.             |
| 5   | **Kotlin only.** No Java sources. Coroutines + Flow for async; no RxJava.                                                      |
| 6   | **Every milestone ends buildable.** `./gradlew :app:installDebug` must produce a launchable app before you stop working.       |
| 7   | **`:safecore` stays UI-free.** It must not reference `MediaProjection`, `WindowManager`, or any Compose symbol.                |
| 8   | **No features outside `SPEC.md` §1.2.** If it isn't in scope, it isn't in scope. §1.3 lists what to refuse.                    |

## Stop and ask the human

Do not improvise around these:

- **The M1 parity gate fails** — on-device model output doesn't match the Python reference within `1e-2`. Do not add a fudge factor, do not lower the tolerance, do not proceed to M2. The cause is almost always `Preprocessor.kt`; see `SPEC.md` M1 for the diagnostic order.
- A permission flow fails on a physical device in a way `SPEC.md` §4 doesn't cover.
- A milestone exceeds **2× its stated time budget**.
- You want to add something not in scope, or remove something that is.
- Dependency resolution has been fighting you for **more than 30 minutes**.

Stating a blocker clearly is a successful outcome. Silently working around one is not.

---

## Device roles

Do not swap these. They're recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

- **Device A (budget)** — primary development device. Default target for `installDebug`. Performance problems must surface here first.
- **Device B (flagship)** — demo and headline numbers only.

Both devices appear in the M5 success criteria at different thresholds. See `SPEC.md` §1.4.

---

## Commands

```bash
# Build + install (default: Device A)
./gradlew :app:installDebug

# Verify the no-INTERNET claim — MUST return nothing
aapt dump permissions app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk | grep -i internet

# Tests
./gradlew :safecore:test              # JVM: gate, hash, policy
./gradlew :safecore:connectedAndroidTest   # device: M1 parity gate

# Diagnostics
adb logcat -s Sophiel:D
adb shell dumpsys media_projection
adb shell dumpsys activity services dev.sophiel | grep -i foreground
```

## Traps that have already cost people days

Each is specified in detail in `SPEC.md`. Listed here because they fail _silently_ — no exception, no stack trace, just wrong behaviour.

- **Missing `image.close()`** → the `ImageReader` stalls permanently after exactly 2 frames. No error is thrown. If capture dies after two frames, this is why.
- **Ignoring `rowStride` padding** → a diagonally skewed bitmap that still looks like a plausible image in the debugger. §4.5.
- **Preprocessing mismatch** → plausible-looking but meaningless scores. Check channel order, normalization range, interpolation, tensor layout. §M1.
- **Starting `MediaProjection` before the foreground service** → `SecurityException` on API 34+. The ordering in §4.4 is load-bearing.
- **Recreating the `VirtualDisplay` on rotation** → `SecurityException`. Use `resize()` + `setSurface()`.
- **Reusing a consent `Intent`** → `SecurityException`. Request fresh every session; there is no "remember this choice".
- **Omitting `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE`** on the overlay → steals input from every other app; the device feels bricked.
- **Compressed `.tflite` in assets** → the model can't be memory-mapped and fails to load. `noCompress += "tflite"`.

## Commit convention

```
M2: add skin gate to DetectionPipeline
M3: handle rowStride padding in FrameSource
docs: record LiteRT version decision
```

Milestone prefix, imperative mood. One logical change per commit.

## Feature freeze

**End of M4 is a hard feature freeze.** M5 is measurement, M6 is writing. After the freeze, the only acceptable code changes are bug fixes for failing verification items and instrumentation needed for benchmarks. If you find yourself adding a feature in week 5, stop.
